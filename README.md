# Video-Game-Engine
I have been using Unity 3D game engine for quite some time - why not making my own engine? With that in my mind a few years ago i started developing my game engine. 
Made this classical ball game in an hour. My game engine can easily render over 5000 balls without any performance issues. I use Box2D for physics and OpenGL for graphics.

*Engine written in C++
