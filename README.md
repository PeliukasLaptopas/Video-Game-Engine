# Video-Game-Engine
I have been using Unity 3D game engine for quite some time - why not making my own engine? With that in my mind a few years ago i started developing my game engine. I made sure to put a lot of effort so that using it would be as easy as Unity 3D - you can draw circles and boxes with only two lines of code! I have BoxCollider2D, CircleCollider2D and RigidBody2D implemented, so Unity developers would easily understand this engine.

Made this classical ball game in only 30 minutes where you can move a ball around the screen and control gravity direction! My game engine can easily render over 5000 balls without any performance issues. I use Box2D for physics and OpenGL for graphics.
